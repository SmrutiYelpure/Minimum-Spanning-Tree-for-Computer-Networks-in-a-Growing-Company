# Minimum-Spanning-Tree-for-Computer-Networks-in-a-Growing-Company
This repository contains an implementation of various algorithms for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph, specifically designed for computer networks in a growing company. The algorithms implemented are Prim's Algorithm, a modified version of Prim's Algorithm (based on a research paper), and Kruskal's Algorithm.
